# Ebilueye Collins - CV Project

Welcome to my **Curriculum Vitae** project!  
This is a personal initiative to showcase my skills and background as a Junior Frontend Developer, presented using only HTML and basic web development standards.

### ðŸŒ± About This Project
After several on-and-off attempts at learning and building, Iâ€™m starting fresh â€” stronger, more consistent, and more intentional than ever.  
This project marks my renewed commitment to growing my web development skills, from foundations to full-fledged applications.

### ðŸ“„ Highlights
- Built with semantic HTML for better structure and accessibility.
- SEO-optimized with meta tags and Open Graph tags for improved online sharing.
- Favicon and responsive design basics included.
- Deployed via GitHub Pages for live access and easier portfolio sharing.

### ðŸ“Œ Why This Matters
Consistency beats perfection.  
This simple project symbolizes a bigger journey â€” proof that every small step matters and that progress (no matter how slow at times) *is still progress*.
